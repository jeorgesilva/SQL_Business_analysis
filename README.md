# SQL_Magist_Business_analysis

Summary

This project analyzes a Brazilian e-commerce dataset (Magist) to assess its suitability as a strategic partner for EINIAC, a high-end tech company looking to enter the Brazilian market. The analysis focuses on a specific period (April 2017 to March 2018), evaluating the platform's market potential for high-value products, its logistical efficiency, and overall operational reliability.

Languages and Libraries Used

    SQL: Utilized for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.

    Google Slides: Employed to create a visual presentation of the results for a business audience.

Key Learnings

    Data-driven Decision Making: Learned to translate high-level business questions (e.g., "Is Magist a good partner?") into specific, measurable metrics and to support a business recommendation with concrete data points.

    SQL for Complex Analysis: Mastered the use of advanced SQL features like CASE WHEN for data categorization, WITH (Common Table Expressions) for simplifying complex, multi-step queries, and chained JOINs for manipulating data from multiple tables.

    Effective Communication: Gained experience in structuring and presenting a technical analysis in a concise and compelling way for a non-technical audience. The goal was to tell a clear story in a short presentation.

    Data Visualization: Practiced creating diverse visualizations in Google Slides to represent geographical, quantitative, and qualitative data effectively.

Challenges Overcame

    Inconsistent Data Formats: Faced challenges with a database schema that required extensive JOINs across multiple tables to connect data points like product prices, geographic locations, and customer reviews.

    Handling Database-Specific Syntax: Overcame issues with date functions, adjusting the code for the specific database syntax used.

    Validating Conclusions: The most significant challenge was validating the conclusion based on data. Instead of a simple yes or no answer, the analysis revealed nuances, requiring a more strategic and contextualized recommendation.

Additional Reflections

This project highlights the importance of not just having technical skills, but also a strong business understanding. The initial analysis revealed that the numbers were not entirely compatible with EINIAC, but a deeper analysis showed that the real challenge would be entering a new market segment, which completely changes the approach of the final recommendation.
